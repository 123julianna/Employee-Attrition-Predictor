# Employee-Attrition-Predictor
The Employee Attrition Predictor takes the previous year's employee details and the current year's employee details as input, and using machine learning algorithms predicts which employees may leave the company in the current year.  Such prediction is crucial in today's world as it not only allows companies to take appropriate action to prevent attrition but also allows them to make better hiring decisions.

This user-friendly app takes CSV datasets as input and generates a table with employee details as well as attrition/retention details, and also creates graphs and plots for visual data analysis.
